      <p class="w3-justify">Our product, MOUSAI is a podcast hosting provider with live and recorded streaming and
        different channels as well as listeners can search for the podcast topics of their choice, listen and request to
        connect to a live podcast to chat and share their thoughts if the host accepts. It is a platform where everyone
        can podcast on their own channel and subscribe to others. So, we are always looking for an all-in-one platform
        to make user communication more accessible and engaging. This application is focussed on the user engagement
        around the podcasts.

      <h3>Use Cases</h3>
      <h4>Podcasters</h4>
      <p class="w3-justify">Mike is an influencer from Twitch and Tiktok. Right now he wants to find a place to create
        his own podcast to amplify his voice. That’s why he chose MOUSAI. Mike turned to live-streaming to promote his
        podcasts and tried to attract listeners. People love listening to live content, so now he hosts the podcasts
        live. For Mike, it’s been a great way to open up his reach. Live-streaming represents the democratization of
        news casting. Mike is impressed with the functions of interacting with his followers. He can get active and
        updated responses from comments and direct messages to make some adjustments. Today, there are millions of
        live-streaming channels you can tune into; We’re no longer limited by traditional channels found on
        television/radio. If you have a powerful message to deliver, there’s an audience out there for you, and it’s
        easier than ever before to reach them and engage.
      </p>


      <h4>Subscribers/Listeners</h4>
      <p class="w3-justify">Albert is a busy software engineer who typically spends nearly 2 hours on his commute each
        weekday. On his way to work, he likes to use the bits and pieces of his commute to learn and explore topics he
        is passionate about. Also, he loves the interacting with people having the same interests as him since he is so
        busy with work that he has little chance to chat with others. Albert thinks that a live podcast with chatting
        function will be a good platform that suits his requirements, so he usually listens to podcasts on the subway.
        Albert follows live channels about constellations, talking about the fortune and analyzing the personality
        traits of different constellations signs. Albert often shares his personal ideas in the chatting room with the
        podcaster and other listeners. It makes his commute less boring and also brings entertainment and relaxation to
        his busy day. Albert loves the platform, which gives him the opportunity to chat and talk on live podcasts in
        real-time with like-minded people.

      <h2 class="w3-wide w3-center">High Level Design</h2>
      <h3 id="SystemArchitecture">System Architecture</h3>
      <p>
        Since this product has a scope to scale up and down both horizontally as well as vertically based on the number
        of listeners and podcasters, as well as, the number of features that can be added in the future, we feel
        microservices architecture will best suit the APIs being consumed by user interface consisting of multiple
        devices. The presentation tier is mainly for the user interface and communication layer of the application,
        where the end-user interacts with the application. In MOUSAI, our users could get access to the data on three
        different platforms including web, mobile, and smart device integration such as Alexa apps and smart car apps.
        <a href="#fig1.1">Figure 1.1</a> is the high-level architecture depicting that the users will be able to access
        the application through three interfaces:
      <ul>
        <li>Listener: Web, Mobile, Smart devices</li>
        <li>Podcaster: Web </li>
        <li>Admin: Web</li>
        <br>
        All the requests will go to the web server and the static content will be stored there and the dynamic content
        will be served by the API gateway.
        We are using web socket APIs as well as REST APIs. Web server and Application server of this tier are kinds of
        server which are employed to deliver sites and therefore the latter deals with application operations performed
        between users and back-end business applications of the organization. The audio files and all the data will be
        stored in heterogeneous data sources. The audio files and the chat messages will be stored in Cloud managed
        services such as Amazon S3. The user information will be stored in the RDBMS and the audio metadata will be
        stored in a NOSQL database.
        </p>

        <h4>Domain Design</h4>
        <p>In <a href="#fig1.2">Figure 1.2</a> is the domain design of MOUSAI to be more clear of the modules involved
          in the product. We have defined the subdomain based on its inner problem space logic
          and business requirements. The core domain is Podcast Social media platform and all others are the sub-domains
          including listeners subdomain, podcasters subdomain, live chat subdomain, notification subdomain and
          admin activities subdomain.</p>

        <h4>Data Flow Diagrams</h4>
        <p>Below are some flow diagrams for more clarity on the usage of the system by each user role defined:</p>

          As seen in the <a href="#fig1.3">Figure 1.3</a>, after login/signup, the podcaster will land on the home page
          where he/she will have multiple options to upload and publish a podcast, livestream, see the channel and
          podcast stats and edit or delete own podcasts, reply to the comments and report the comments/users which all
          is mentioned in the diagram.

          As seen in the <a href="#fig1.4">Figure 1.4</a>, after login/signup, the listener will land on the home page
          where he/she will have multiple options including searching for podcasts and channels, listening, subscribing,
          commenting, reporting, joining a live podcast, creating a chat room, etc.
        </p>

          he/she will have multiple options including review the reports, see analytics, searching for podcasts and
          channels.

        <h3 style="padding-top: 64px" id="FileStorageDesign">File Storage Design</h3>
        <p>
          Podcast streaming platforms may have a variety of data formats,
          including text, image, and audio types, among others.
          Extracting and structuring the information contained in these data is not always useful or efficient.
          This is where the document storage component comes in.
          The purpose of the document storage component is to securely
          and persistently store any files that the user uploads to the system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Amazon S3 is an ideal choice for file storage components.
          Amazon S3 offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance.
          It is also affordable, well-supported, mature and easy to configure.
          Every file uploaded to the system can be dumped to an S3 bucket and associated with an entity in the database
          component.
          We can also use S3 to store backups of all data.
          Data backups can be automated using tools provided by AWS and stored privately in a separate S3 bucket.

          There are two popular database types: RDBMS and NoSQL, each with their own advantages and challenges.
          RDBMS is ideal for structured data while NoSQL databases can easily handle any data format,
          such as structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data in a single data store.
          Using NoSQL, we can easily identify all the metadata the system needs to capture.</p>

        <p>Since MOUSAI is a streaming platform that needs to support variation in metadata with new features and
          requirements.
          To maintain this complex and large-scale system, it is better to use NoSQL to handle our metadata database.
          NoSQL models provide several features that we will make heavy use of. There are no relational constraints on
          the data, and it does not need to be even tabular.
          NoSQL offers performance at a higher scale by typically giving up strong consistency.
          But for user-related data including user personal information and role information, RDBMS is a good choice.
          SQL databases are a better fit for heavy duty or complex transactions because
          it’s more stable and ensure data integrity.</p>
        <p>Also, we are using AWS Cloud service, Simple Notification Service, SNS which is a fully managed graph
          database.</p>

        <p>Below is the database design.</p>

        <h3 style="padding-top: 64px" id="APIDesign">API Design</h3>
        <p>For the services, we have chosen to go with microservices architecture as we can see a lot of use cases to
          use microservices. This application is all based on the number of users, listeners to podcasters ratio, and
          trend on which service there is the most load, and we should be able to scale up and down the services based
          on that. Also adding new services would be so much easier by using the microservices architecture. </p>
        <p>For other services, maintaining separation of concerns, there will be no downtime for other services.</p>

        <p>In the <a href="#APIDesign">Figure 4.1</a> we can see some more detailed view of the <a href="#fig1.1">high
            level design</a>. Here, we can see:
        <ul>
          <li><b>Identity Provider</b>: This service will be helpful in all the functional requirements as this is a
            closed system and need authentication and authorisation to access the resources. Also, NFR1, NFR3 and NFR9
            are covered with this service in the architecture.</li>
          <li><b>API Gateway</b>: All the API calls will go to the microservices through the API gateway.</li>
          <li><b>Content Delivery Network</b>: We will use a cloud manged CDN service like AWS Cloud Front for the
            faster content delivery to the end user reducing the latency and improving the performance of the system.
          </li>
          <li><b>Microservices</b>: All the services will be created following a microservices architecture.</li>
          <li><b>File Storage</b> We will use the cloud managed services such as AWS S3 for storing the audio files and the chats.</li>
          <li><b>NoSql</b>:Since we are using microservices, we can have heterogeneous databases, so for the audio metadata and comments on the podcasts will use a NoSQL DB such as AWS Dynamo Database.</li>
          <li><b>Message Broker</b>: Since this is a microservice environment, we will use a message broker for the interaction between the services.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h3 style="padding-top: 64px" id="WebApplicationDesign">User Interface Design</h3>
        <p>Usability of the application plays a very important role in assessing the quality of the application.
          As there are multiple interfaces of the application for different roles of user as mentioned earlier. We need
          a design architecture for which the framework creates all the variants for easing the maintenance of the
          application.</p>
        <h4>Web and Mobile Application Design</h4>

        <p>Single page application will be a good fit for the application as it can be used and can load elements
          asynchronously depending on user actions, the page does not need to be reloaded when navigating between
          different pages, which will ensure an uninterrupted user experience and function like a standard desktop
          application.
          This will reduce server load at any given point and shorten page loads, which also aids in improving the user
          experience and fulfill NFR4.
        </p>
        <h5>Model View Controller Architectural pattern</h5>
        <p>By using event listener functions that modify the application's state and re-render that state to the page we
          can build an interactive application. Most of the JavaScript application frameworks are based on some
          variation of the MVC pattern.</p>

        <img src="images/MVC.png" alt="MVC pattern" width="100%" height="100%">
        <h4>Smart Device Audio Application Design</h4>
        <p>Creating apps for multiple smart devices which responds to your voice, will have different pieces of hardware
          but the fundamentals of all applications will be common and in the backend the applications will interact with
          the microservices/APIs to get the data, buffer and stream audio. Also, it will require to have a web/mobile
          interface for the setup. </p>


        <h3 style="padding-top: 64px" id="RequirementTraceabilityMatrix">Requirement Traceability Matrix(RTM)</h3>
        <p>
          Here is the Requirement Traceability Matrix providing a quick reference for the relationship between the
          requirements and the system components.
          Functional requirements define what a product must do, what its features and functions are. Nonfunctional
          requirements describe the general properties of a system.
          An RTM ensures that projects do everything they set out to do. This step-by-step process helps identify the
          requirements and the products that are required to be tested successfully.
          It also helps in determining the project's direction and timeline.

    <!-- The Design Rationale Section -->
    <div class="w3-container w3-content w3-padding-64" style="max-width:800px" id="designRationale">
      <h2 class="w3-wide w3-center">Design Rationale</h2>
      <h3>System Architecture Rationale</h3>
      <p>In this application, we have several modules to serve each requirement. They are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Identity Provider</li>
        <li>API Gateway</li>
        <li>AWS Cloud Front (Content Delivery Network)</li>
        <li>Microservices</li>
        <li>AWS S3 File Storage</li>
        <li>AWS Dynamo Databases (NoSql)</li>
        <li>Message Broker</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Identity Provider:</h4>
      <p>An identity provider is a system that creates, stores, and manages digital identities. It can either directly
        authenticate the user or can provide authentication services to third-party service providers (apps, websites,
        or other digital services). In our application, we are expecting people to have at least a google email id to
        log in and use google’s Single Sign-On service to provide authentication to use the application. This allows
        users to create a profile in MOUSAI.
      </p>
      <h4>API Gateway:</h4>
      <p>An API management tool sits between client and backend services. An API gateway acts as a reverse proxy to
        accept all API calls, aggregate the services required to fulfill them and return the appropriate result. They
        are used to protect the application from overuse and abuse by providing an extra layer of authentication and
        rate-limiting services. They also provide us with statistics on how the APIs are used that help us with the
        future monetization of particular services.
      </p>

      <h4>AWS Cloud Front:</h4>
      <p>AWS Cloud Front works as the content delivery network(CDN) in our application because we can have a large
        number of
        users across the world and should have low latency for the response. CDN refers to a geographically distributed
        group
        of servers that work together to provide fast delivery of data. It allows for the quick transfer of assets
        needed for loading application content including HTML pages, javascript files, stylesheets, images, and videos.
        It can also help our application protect from common attacks such as DDOS attacks.
      </p>

      <h4>Microservices:</h4>
      <p>Microservices architecture is very helpful when a few of the services are more critical than other services.
        When a change is made in one service, we can deploy only one service while keeping alive the rest of the
        services. This helps us save the downtime of critical services. Scalability is also easy with this architecture
        being incorporated into the application. That is why we have different services for different requirements like
        those mentioned below:
      <ul>
        <li>Users Services - to make CRUD on the profile data of each user.</li>
        <li>Podcast Upload/ modify Service - upload, edit, and delete a podcast by a podcaster.</li>
        <li>Live Stream Service - to live stream a podcast by a podcaster.</li>
        <li>Listener Podcast Service - to stream, like, and comment on a podcast by a listener.</li>
        <li>Notification/ Pub-sub Service(Event based) - to send notifications to the users for every event that
          happened involving them or their content like a new reply to their message, like and comment on their podcast,
          new podcast by the channel or user they follow, updates on the issues they reported, etc</li>
        <li>Chatting Service - to chat, reply, delete, and create chat rooms by the users.</li>
        <li>Analytics Service - to view the analytics of the content of the podcaster</li>

      </ul>
      </p>

      <h4>Message Broker:</h4>
      <p>A message broker is a software that enables services to communicate with each other and exchange information.
        This allows interdependent services to “talk” with one another directly, even if they were written in different
        languages or implemented on different platforms. They are used in our application to delegate a few tasks to
        other services as sending a notification to a user when the admin makes changes to their issue report, sending
        notification to the user regarding the user interactions in their podcast.
      </p>

      <h3 style="padding-top: 64px" id="DataTierRationale">Data Tier Rationale</h3>
      <h4>Amazon S3</h4>
      <p>
        Using S3 as our file storage gives us everything we want with minimal investment.
        S3 provides all the tools necessary to properly configure file storage. S3 provides high availability of the
        podcasts audio to the
        listeners, and we can store any amount of audio duration in the S3. And S3 will take care of the data backup.
      </p>
      <p>Benefits of S3:</p>
      <li><b>Reliable Security</b></li>
      <p>Amazon S3 buckets can only be used by the identity that created them. We can set access permissions per file,
        per bucket, or through IAM (Identity Access Management), which provides complete control over how, where and who
        can frequently access data. Using these rules and permission sets, we can ensure that there is no unauthorized
        access to our data.</p>
      <li><b>Availability</b></li>
      <p>Amazon S3 gives every user, its service access to the same highly scalable, reliable, fast, inexpensive data
        storage infrastructure that Amazon uses to run its own global network of websites. </p>
      <li><b>Simplicity of Management</b></li>
      <p>Amazon S3 has a very user-friendly web interface which takes out the usual hard work of maintaining security,
        optimizing storage classes and managing the data transfer in the most suitable way.</p>
      <li><b>Flexibility</b></li>
      <p>S3 is ideal for a wide range of uses like data storage, data backup, software delivery, data archiving,
        disaster recovery, website hosting, mobile applications, and much more.</p>

      <h4>RDBMS</h4>
      <p>A Relational Database consists of appropriately arranged tables from which data can be administered and
        operated in various different ways without having to rearrange the entire set of database tables.
        SQL queries are applied for both interactive queries to fetch information and gathering data for reporting and
        analysis purposes.
        This helps in making user-related operations and processes convenient, and maintaining the integrity of data.
      </p>
      <p>Benefits of RDBMS:</p>
      <li><b>Accuracy</b></li>
      <p>In the relational database system, there can be multiple tables related to one another with the use of a
        primary key and foreign key concepts.
        This makes the data to be non-repetitive. There is no chance for duplication of data.
        Hence, the accuracy of data in the relational database is more than any other database system.</p>
      <li><b>Data Integrity</b></li>
      <p>Data integrity is a crucial characteristic of the Relational Database system.
        Sturdy Data entries and legitimacy validations ensure that all the Data in the database confines within suitable
        arrangements and the data necessary for creating the relationships are present.
        This relational reliability amongst the tables in the database helps in avoiding the records from being
        imperfect, isolated or unrelated.
        Data integrity aids in making sure of the relational database’s other significant characteristics like Ease of
        use, precision, and stability of the data.
      </p>
      <li><b>Normalization</b></li>
      <p>The methodical style is maintained for making sure of a relational database structure is liberated of any
        variances that can make a difference in the integrity and accuracy of the tables in the database.
        A normalization process provides a set of regulations, characteristics, and purposes for the database structure
        and evaluation of a relational database model.
      </p>





      <h4>NoSQL</h4>
      <p>NoSQL databases are designed for fast, simple queries, vast data, and frequent application changes which
        perfectly fits for the requirement of
        saving audio metadata, comments and default thumbnails.
        In addition, these databases also make programming much simpler for developers.</p>
      <p>Benefits of NoSQL:</p>
      <li><b>Flexibility</b></li>
      <p>NoSQL databases offer flexible schemas and also support a variety of data formats that are ideal for building
        MOUSAI that require large data volumes and low latency or response times.</p>
      <li><b>Scalability</b></li>
      <p>NoSQL databases scale out horizontally, which means that they can handle extremely large amounts of data—even
        as the data is growing —in a more efficient way. With MOUSAI’s continue growing users and number of audios, it
        is reasonable using NoSQL. The scale-out architecture of a NoSQL database can be particularly valuable when data
        volume or traffic increases.</p>
      <li><b>Availability</b></li>
      <p>NoSQL databases automatically replicate data across multiple servers, data centers, or cloud resources. In
        turn, this minimizes latency for users, no matter where they’re located.</p>


      <h3 style="padding-top: 64px" id="APIDesignRationale">API Design Rationale</h3>
      <p>We use two different APIs for this product. APIs are necessary to decouple the clients and backend servers in
        the application. They are also needed to bring applications together in order to perform a designed function
        built around sharing data and executing pre-defined processes. They work as the middleman, allowing developers
        to build new programmatic interactions between the various applications people and businesses use on a daily
        basis.</p>
      <h4>Rest API:</h4>
      <p>Rest APIs are useful when the clients need to communicate with the backend servers for the data. These are
        stateless, meaning every connection to the server is a new one. They are helpful when you need only a single
        machine to trigger the request. In our application, we can use these APIs for all client requests except the
        streaming services.</p>
      <h4>WebSocket API:</h4>
      <p>These APIs are written over TCP connections. For streaming, we will need a connection that is reliable and
        sequential as we need to send the packets or bits of the data or audio (in our case) sequentially. We can use
        Ajax long polling for the streaming services. But they are not efficient in our case as we are expecting at
        least 1000 users per second requesting to listen to audio.</p>

      

      <h3 style="padding-top: 64px" id="WebApplicationDesignRationale">User Interface Design Rationale</h3>
      <p> For this application, we have suggested a single page application because it can be used for on any screen and will have low latency due to async calls and dynamic components. We want our
        application to be screen-atheist. We can use framework such as React.js which can help create applications which are both single page applications and
        screen-atheist. It means they work better on any screen the application is opened on.</p>
      <p>
        The MVC architecture helps the application to decouple the data manipulation activities and user interactions.
        It is easy to code, maintain and test as they support test driven development and separation of concern makes it easier to incorporate changes and enhancements.
        This architecture helps us separate data and business logic that is easy to maintain and organize. We want to
        keep the frontend as light as possible because we have time-consuming processes happening in the backend such as uploading of the podcasts.
      </p>
      <p>The APIs will return JSON response so can be consumed by any frontend application. The smart devices, mobile application and
        web application frontend might vary but the microservices and APIs  will remain same for all the devices. This allows the application
        support all the devices and easy maintainability.</p>

            This paper contains enough design for us to start working on the MOUSAI podcast system. The majority of our
            choices have been supported by tested methods for creating web applications.The center of the architecture design is using model view controller for the front end seperation of concerns and help in maintainance and enhancements and the controller will call the APIs in microservices architecture which has various benefits as described. Also, using the cloud managed services such as S3, CloudFront, SNS, DynamoDB being distributed and reliable, have already the security, performance, backup and scalability features.
            It is hard to foresee every potential issue or design defect. The division of responsibilities will make it simpler to make design
            adjustments if any unforeseen problems should occur. Please keep in mind that all design decisions involve compromises if any adjustments are necessary.
